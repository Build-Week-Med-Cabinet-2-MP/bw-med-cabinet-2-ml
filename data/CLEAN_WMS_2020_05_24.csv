24K Gold,24k-gold,hybrid,"24K Gold, also known as 24K or Kosher Tangie, is a cross of Tangie and Kosher Kush, bred by DNA Genetics in Amsterdam. The seed bank has identified three 24K Gold phenotypes; one of which has a prominent kush flavor with citrus undertones, and another with a Tangie-leaning flavor. 

According to DNA Genetics, the strain has an Indica-leaning lineage, but grows tall and produces above-average yields (450 to 550 grams per square meter, or 0.99 to 1.12 pounds per square foot) of resinous buds in a 63-70 day flowering period. The breeder also claims that 24K Gold produces a strong tangerine scent and kush-flavored buds. 24K Gold won third Place at the Milano Secret Cup in 2018.

303 OG Kush,303-og-kush,hybrid,"303 OG Kush is a strain with various sources of origin. Below are several anecdotes about the strain's inception. 

Origin #1
303 OG, also called 303 Kush or 303 OG Kush, is reported to have first been cultivated in Colorado by the breeder known as Zombo and is an Indica-dominant cross between a Pre-'98 Bubba Kush and Reservoir ChemDawg IC3.

Reported by online sources to have been selected for its phenotypes by Colorado’s Hill Billy, the strain was named after Denver’s area code. Clones are the best option for cultivators looking to grow 303 OG, as seeds are not easily obtained.

Origin #2
The 303 OG grown by The Clinic in Colorado is an Indica-dominant cross between Kosher Kush and Ghost OG. Available throughout Colorado, flowers from The Clinic’s 303 OG strain provides a sweet and spicy flavor profile that’s popular for its OG characteristics, powerful body high, and cerebral effects.

The Clinic’s 303 OG Nug Run Sugar Budder won first place in 2014 for Best U.S. Concentrates at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup. The Clinic’s 303 OG THC content has been tested as high as 20%, and the strain reportedly helps mitigate physical discomfort, apprehension, insomnia, and loss of appetite.

ACDC is a parent to several CBD-rich hybrids. Sin City Seeds offers four ACDC hybrids with varying CBD-to-THC ratios — Thunderstruck (an S1 hybrid of ACDC and ACDC), Treasure Island (Swiss Gold and ACDC), HarleSin (ACDC and Harlequin), and Incredible Power (OmRita, BluePower, and ACDC).

Blue Dream,blue-dream,hybrid,"Blue Dream is a popular strain with various sources of origin. Below are several anecdotes about the strain's inception. 

Origin 1
The clone-only version of Blue Dream is a Sativa-dominant hybrid that was first cultivated in Northern California. A cross of DJ Short’s Blueberry F5 strain and Santa Cruz Haze, Blue Dream produces several noteworthy phenotypes and is known to produce varied phenotypes with heavy yields.

Origin 2 
Blue Dream by Mystic Seeds is an Indica-dominant cross of DJ Short’s Blueberry strain crossed with a powerful OG Kush from Los Angeles. 

Origin 3
A new Blue Dream by DJ Short was reportedly recently created and branded as Azure Haze, after crossing a Silver Haze mother and a Blueberry F4 father. 

Origin 4
Blue Dream by Humboldt Seed Organization is a Sativa-dominant strain derived from feminized seeds. Created from a cross of Blueberry and Super Silver Haze (SSH), this version of Blue Dream is suitable for cultivating indoors or in a greenhouse.","Origin 1
When cultivated outdoors, Blue Dream hits full maturation by late October in the Northern Hemisphere, late April in the Southern Hemisphere. The strain thrives when grown indoors in a hydroponic environment and finishes flowering about 8 to 10 weeks after the 12/12 light cycle switch, according to Dark Heart Nursery. For a more robust flavor profile, many growers choose to cultivate this strain in soil with organic nutrients.

Origin 2
This version of Blue Dream is known for producing a short, dark-green plant that grows slowly in the vegetative phase and produces modest yields. Due to the Kush influence, this variety is an early-stretching plant that takes on more Indica qualities when flowering and finishes with chunky, pungent blue-hued flowers. This version of Blue Dream is considered to be a good commercial strain that’s highly resistant to mold and pests. 

Origin 3
DJ Short’s version of Blue Dream grows relatively slow during the vegetation cycle and stretches dramatically once the flower cycle begins. Training these plants via the Sea of Green or Screen of Green technique helps to maximize yield. DJ Short’s Blue Dream strain produces dense, rounded flowers that create an above-average yield.

Origin 4
The strain’s growth pattern is slender with narrow fan leaves. The light green calyxes turn golden near harvest time and typically produce swollen teardrop-shaped colas that outproduce other versions of this strain. 

Humboldt Seeds also offers an autoflowering version of Blue Dream that’s ready for harvest about 11 weeks after planting. The autoflowering Blue Dream strain produces a short,  bushy plant that produces long side-branches with wide internodal spacing. From seed to smoke, Blue Dream Auto is typically ready for harvest within 75 days of germination. Featuring a rich Blueberry Haze flavor, this auto hybrid is zesty enough to entice skilled growers and simple enough for novice cultivators to gain their first taste of success.

Bubba Kush,bubba-kush,hybrid,"Bubba Kush originated in the early 1990s as an accidental hybrid that crossed itself in Matt Berger’s garden. 

Also known as Bubba, Berger discovered a phenotype called Kush -- a cut of the Afghan Kush landrace strain that grew in the wild. While experimenting indoors with these Kush genetics, a crop of Northern Lights growing in the same room ended up intermingling with Kush, leaving behind a set of seeds. 

The seeds ended up growing into the first Bubba Kush flower, which became a major commercial success that attracted celebrity consumers such as Cypress Hill, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Its popularity led to several copycat buds in dispensaries, so Berger renamed his genetics OG Kush to differentiate his crop from the rest.  

Bubba Kush is a mostly Indica-dominant strain, with short internodes, squat stature and broad fan leaves, thanks to its Afghan and backcrossed OG Kush heritage.

In the Netherlands, each breeder cultivated a slightly different Bubble Gum phenotype. Adam at T.H. Seeds describes his version as “mostly Indica,” while Simon at Cerebral Seeds considers his variation of the strain “mostly Sativa.” 

Bubble Gum has won 13 awards, including 2nd at High Times Cannabis Cup in 1995, 1st Outdoor at Spannabis Cup in 2005, 1st Outdoor at Spannabis Cup in 2006 and 1st Hybrid at the 4th annual Jack Herer Cup in 2018. 

Today, both regular and feminized seeds are available from Serious Seeds, and Bubble Gum is the only inbred strain offered by the seed bank. Simon reports Bubble Gum seeds produce a stable, uniform grow of strong, sturdy plants with thick stems. It lists the strain as both an outdoor and indoor cultivar, with an indoor flowering time of 56-63 days. It’s said to emit a sweet, bubble gum fragrance and carry a prominent strawberry flavor when it comes from feminized seeds.

Cannatonic,cannatonic,hybrid,"Also known as the CBD Queen, Cannatonic is a hybrid from Spain’s Resin Seeds. Reportedly introduced around 2008, and among the first high-CBD strain, Cannatonic is a cross of Reina Madre and NYC Diesel. 

The strain took 3rd Sativa at the 2008 High Times Cannabis Cup and is primarily recommended for medicinal use. The seed bank offers three main phenotypes of the strain — one with a 1:1 THC-to-CBD ratio, one with high CBD and low THC and one with a high THC-to-CBD ratio.

It spawned several notable phenotypes, including Cannatonic #4, Cannatonic X and Cannatonic B, and Highlo, a Cannatonic IBL from House of the Great Gardener. One of the earliest phenotypes to carry its own name, SuperCBDx, was developed by breeder PJ after he contracted a serious illness and focused on high-CBD strains, which are commonly used for medicinal purposes. From there, it was reportedly refined by Spanish seed bank Genofarm, whose version boasts a 26:1 CBD-to-THC ratio. 

Cannatonic has also served as the genetic base for several CBD-rich hybrids including Cancer’s Nightmare (Cannatonic and White Nightmare) from Sin City Seeds, CannaBerry (Cannatonic and Blackberry) from Apothecary Genetics, Hawkeye (Cannatonic and Mt. Rainer) from RedEyed Genetics, Hazy Med CBD (Super Silver Haze, Skunk #1 and Cannatonic) from Poppa Pain Strains, and VCDC from Moxie Seeds. Resin Seeds’ own Dieseltonic is a backcrossing of Cannatonic and NYC Diesel, and has the same CBD potential as Cannatonic.

Cherry Wine and The Wife, two hemp strains commonly grown in the USA, are also Cannatonic hybrids. Resin Seeds estimates that 80% or more of all American, Swiss, and Italian grown hemp varieties include Cannatonic in their lineage.  

When cultivating Cannatonic, its breeder reports Indica-like growth patterns and a 63-70 day flowering period. There’s minimal genetic variation, according to tests from Phylos Bioscience. Resin Seeds also reports the strain is both pest- and powdery mildew-resistant and recommends indoor growing with a light source set higher than usual over the plants. Resin Seeds also reports that Cannatonic’s aromas range from strawberry, cherry, mandarin peel, and grape to haze and diesel; with myrcene being the strain’s dominant terpene.

Chemdog,chemdog,hybrid,"Chemdog, or Chemdawg, was created in the early 1990s in the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert. 

Dead concerts had a reputation for being trade centers for cannabis cultivars, and during this particular show, a breeder named Chem purchased an ounce of Dogbud from fellow growers P-Bud and Joe Brand. The flower -- which supposedly originated along the California-Oregon border -- tasted so strongly of chemicals that Joe Brand nicknamed it Chem. Chem (the breeder) combined the two names, and Chemdog was the result.

Following the Grateful Dead tour, Chem popped Chemdog the seeds and created three phenotypes. The most famous was Chem 91, which became an instant success and served as the parent strain for some of the most popular cultivars of the past 25 years.

Later, in the early 2000s, the seed bank crossed a hybrid of Skunk #1 and Northern Lights with a hybrid of Northern Lights and AK-47 hybrid to produce what exists today.  Seed bank owner/breeder Simon said he added AK-47 to the equation to upgrade the strain’s genetics and give it a “complex, full-spectrum high without losing the nice yield and flavor.” Serious Seeds carries both regular and feminized Chronic seeds.

Chronic won seven cannabis awards, including 3rd prize at High Times Cannabis Cup in 1994, 1st at La Bella Flor Cup Spain in 2003 and 1st at Highlife Cup Spain in 2004. 

Serious Seeds reports the sweet-and-spicy flavor of the original Chronic remains intact in its current iteration of the strain. It also reports high yields of enormous colas from Chronic during a 56-63-day flowering period. Chronic is best grown indoors but responds well to natural sunlight within a protected environment.

From there, he aimed to create a super-strain that would allow him to share Princess with the world. First, he paired a Princess female with a Shiva Skunk male to add plant strength, and used a triple backcrossing method called “cubing” to create the parent strain Cinderella 88. Finally, he bred Cinderella 88 with Princess once more to achieve what breeders call the Holy Grail of Hybrids -- Cinderella 99.

Through generations of inbreeding by local growers, Colombian Gold became one of the most stable cannabis strains on the market. While less popular than its cousin, Acapulco Gold, Colombian Gold still holds a place in cannabis history. Sam the Skunkman used it as half of his Skunk #1 creation in the 1960s, and it has been used for numerous hybrids over the last few decades.

As a true landrace Sativa, Colombian Gold produces tall, branchy plants that bloom within
75-90 days when grown indoors. However, a moderately experienced grower can tease out a November yield of up to 600 grams per square meter in an outdoor garden in the Northern Hemisphere, and harvest in May in the Southern Hemisphere.

Durban Poison,durban-poison,sativa,"Durban Poison has deep roots in the Sativa landrace gene pool. The strain’s historic phenotypes were first noticed in the late 1970s by one of America’s first International strain hunters, Ed Rosenthal. According to cultivation legend, Rosenthal was in South Africa in search of new genetics and ran across a fast flowering strain in the port city of Durban. After arriving home in the U.S., Rosenthal conducted his own selective breeding process on his recently imported seeds, then begin sharing. Rosenthal gave Mel Frank some of his new South African seeds, and the rest was cannabis history. 

Frank, who wrote the “Marijuana Grower’s Guide Deluxe"" in 1978, modified the gene pool to increase resin content and decrease the flowering time. In search of a short-season varietal that could hit full maturation on the U.S. East Coast, Frank’s crossbreeding efforts resulted in two distinct phenotypes, the “A” line and “B” line. The plant from Frank’s “A” line became today’s Durban Poison, while the “B” line was handed off to Amsterdam breeder David Watson, also known as “Sam the Skunkman.” 

Durban Poison has a dense, compact bud structure that’s typical of landrace Indica varieties, but the flowers’ elongated and conical shape is more characteristic of a Sativa. When cultivated indoors or in a greenhouse, Durban Poison needs ample room for the production of side branches. Cultivating Durban Poison outside provides an opportunity for this plant to reach its greatest potential. Regardless of whether cultivated indoors or outdoors, Durban Poison requires thorough trellising to support its ample flower production.

Regular and feminized Durban Poison seeds are available through the Dutch Passion Seed Company. Durban Poison won 2nd place in 2013 and 2014 at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup in the Medical Sativa category.

Cookies cultivates a few phenotypes and descendants of the strain named Gelato #42, Dolce Gelato, and a sun-grown Gelato.

Reach said the Ghost OG mother was sourced from Weedzilla of the Devils Harvest Krew (DHK,) and was traded openly with other breeders for more than a decade. He said the two strains produced a Sativa-dominant hybrid that’s easy to grow and offers heavy hields of sugary, trichome-rich buds in a 65-80 day flowering period.  

Rare Darkness carries both regular and feminized Ghost Train Haze seeds. It reports the strain has a hazy, sour aroma and results in an intense, energetic high. In fact, Reach said the strain was disqualified from its first competition because the entry batch tested at 27% THC, test results that judges assumed couldn’t be authentic.

GMO Cookies,gmo-cookies,hybrid,"No, the strain GMO Cookies is not a genetically modified organism but a cross between Chemdawg D and a GSC (formerly Girl Scout Cookies) Forum cut. Also know as GMO or Garlic Cookies, GMO Cookies has been attributed to the breeder Mamiko Seeds, but this skunky phenotype has also been said to have been discovered by a breeder named skunkmasterflex.

While Mamiko seems to have called it just GMO, dispensaries were understandably wary of having that “GMO” label on their shelves and went with Garlic Cookies instead. GMO Cookies is said to carry a flavor of garlic, mushroom, and onion that descends from its Chemdawg lineage.

Divine Genetics also has a strain that’s a cross of Chemdawg #4 and GSC that it calls Chem Cookies. Despite the similar genetics, it appears to be a different strain with different phenotypes for both parents,  although it’s worth noting that some people do confuse two strains. GMO Cookies is said to produce olive green buds with bits of purple and orange blanketed by a mantle of trichomes.

Neither seeds or clones of GMO Cookies appear to be available online, but some cultivators possiblymay be able to get a clone from someone.

While the flowering cycle takes roughly 65 days to complete when cultivated indoors, outdoor growers can expect to harvest by late September or early October in the Northern Hemisphere, and late March to early April in the Southern Hemisphere. 

A genetic winner, GDP’s buds won first place in 2015 at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup for Best U.S. Indica.	

Granddaddy Purple has an average THC content of roughly 17 percent, and is typically high in Caryophyllene, alpha-Pinene, and Humulene.

GSC ,gsc,hybrid,"GSC, which was originally known as the Girl Scout Cookies strain, was first bred by Northern California's Cookie Family sometime about 2012. A Sativa-leaning hybrid cross between a cutting of OG Kush and the breeder’s own F1 Durban Poison strain, GSC produces a plant with multiple branches and a powerful flower. The strain has a short stature that is common on strains with Indica lineage and is known for its tight internodal structure, which creates its iconic spear-shaped flowers with lavender calyxes. 

When cultivated indoors, GSC’s flowering time is approximately 62-71 days after switching the light cycle from veg to flower. Outside, growers will need to wait until mid-October in the Northern Hemisphere, mid-April in the Northern Hemisphere, for harvest. Regardless of wherever GSC is cultivated, the plant wants to grow tall and requires training, pruning, and full exposure to light to reach its maximum yield potential. 

The most popular phenotype produced by the first batch of GSC seeds was Thin Mints.

GSC has taken home several High Times Cannabis Cup awards since it was first propagated — including a first-place trophy for Best Hybrid at the 2013 Southern California Cannabis Cup.

Haze,haze,hybrid,"Haze is a cannabis variety with unconfirmed origins that serves as one of the genetic pillars of a huge percentage of today’s Sativa cultivars. 

Online sources trace its beginnings to the 1970s, when Santa Cruz breeders known as the Haze Brothers cultivated Sativa seeds from friend, fellow grower and neighbor David Watson, also known as Sam the Skunkman. 

The brothers combined a landrace Mexican Sativa with a landrace Colombian strain. From there, the best females were selected and then crossed with a southern Indian landrace strain. Finally, the brothers crossed the resulting hybrid with a Thai landrace male to create what’s known as Haze. 

Sam the Skunkman took several of the brothers' Haze seeds to the Netherlands, where he sold the genetics under the name Cultivator’s Choice. Breeders loved the strain’s uplifting qualities and stability so much that it soon became the genetic backbone for many famous phenotypes and hybrids, including Neville’s Haze, Amnesia Haze, Purple Haze, and many more cultivars that won Cannabis Cups.

Headband,headband,hybrid,"Headband by DNA Genetics
Amsterdam’s DNA Genetics used an OG Kush male to pollinate a Sour Diesel female and create Headband, a short and bushy plant during the vegetative phase that makes the most of the available space during the flowering cycle. The strain creates small buds and benefits from aggressive training as a means of improving the plant’s yield.

When cultivated indoors using the SCROG (screen of green) technique, growers will improve their overall yield and flower quality. Indoors, Headband flowers within 9-10 weeks. When grown outdoors, it’s best cultivated in areas with a warmer fall climate as the flowering time takes longer to mature than some strains. Feminized Headband seeds are available through Reserva Privada. 


Headband of Unknown Origin
Another origin of Headband is reportedly an indica-dominant cross between Sour Diesel and a Sensi Seeds Northern Lights cross. Once referred to as Daywrecker Diesel or Underdawg, this genetic combination joined together many commendable traits from its parents’ lineage. Headband was reportedly named Diesel #1 when an East Coast breeder known as Weasel first cultivated the strain in the mid-1990s.

Jesus OG,jesus-og,hybrid,"Jesus OG -- also known as Jesus OG Kush -- was developed while attempting to create a Sour Kush strain. 

Developed by West Coast seed bank TGA Genetics, the goal was producing a fruity-smelling hybrid with lemon flavor undertones to pair with its classic Kush taste. 

TGA co-founder Subcool said the recipe was perfected in 2007 by pollinating a clone-only female -- Hell’s OG that was held by Norstar Genetics -- with pollen from a Jack the Ripper male. 

Jesus OG has two main phenotypes: one with more limonene, which results in a lemony scent reflective of the strain’s Northern Lights #5 ancestry, and one with more Kush-dominant genetics that results in a pinene-dominant terpene profile. 

The high-limonene phenotype is reportedly the more commercial of the two.  

TGA reports cultivators of Jesus OG can expect tall growth and massive yields -- especially when planting outdoors -- with a 50-63 day flowering time. Jesus OG’s leaves are bright green, and its flowers are dense with waxy, trichome-riddled surfaces and prominent orange hair clusters. 

Breeder Subcool describes the Jesus OG high as intoxicating, yet thought-provoking, alleviating pain and providing mental clarity.  The strain was used by breeder Jinxproof to create the 9lb Hammer, which won a cannabis cup in 2017.

Jet Fuel OG,jet-fuel-og,hybrid,"Jet Fuel OG blasted off in Colorado, where experts at 303 Seeds dusted their Aspen OG females with a male High Country Diesel that was a hybrid of the seed bank’s Original Diesel/East Coast Sour Diesel. 

However, another source claims the strain originated in Southern California, the result of Dr. Greenthumbs’ genetics expertise.

So while Jet Fuel OG’s genetic heritage is debatable, its creators established the strain’s brand in 2017 to rise above would-be imitators and shine in its smelly splendor. The strain’s petrol stink and fuel flavor have the potential to propel users out of the stratosphere with a heady, energetic high that inevitably crashes into utter relaxation. 

The strain is a true hybrid, indicated by its moderate height and a 9-10-week flowering period. This lady is best grown indoors by moderately experienced growers who know how to cut back her top-heavy fan leaves and work with regular photoperiod cycles. 

The strain was reported by The Cannabist to be Indica-leaning, often clocking THC percentages in the teens, with few CBD or cannabinoids. 

With a bouquet of myrcene and caryophyllene -- and the lemony smell of limonene -- it may seem fitting the strain is also called G6, after the Gulfstream G650 jet, since both claim to offer luxurious effects.

Named after MzJill -- as well as for its candy-citrus, limonene and pinene-dominant scent profile and tropical jelly bean flavor, Jilly Bean was among High Times’ Top Ten Strains of 2007. It was named the magazine’s best Sativa of 2014 and took 1st place at the Adam Dunn Show Invitational.  

Jilly Bean is no longer carried by TGA Genetics and is now in the hands of MzJill’s seed bank, Oregon-based MzJill Genetics. According to Subcool, the Jilly Bean currently bred by MzJill is an open-pollinated F2 hybrid version of the strain. 

MzJill Genetics reports Jilly Bean grows medium to tall, with resinous, trichome-heavy flowers and leaves ranging from bright green to burgundy to purple. And its effects are described as uplifting, euphoric and giggly.

Lemon Skunk,lemon-skunk,hybrid,"Lemon Skunk -- a hybrid from Amsterdam’s DNA Genetics -- originates from the legendary Skunk #1 — a ubiquitous strain in the cannabis world since its commercial debut in 1985. 

To create this uniquely sweet and tasty Skunk hybrid, the seed bank crossed two different Skunk #1 phenotypes. The male, a prized Skunk frequently used for breeding purposes, came from Netherlands breeder Eddie, while the female was a citrusy Skunk phenotype from Lemon Man in Las Vegas. 

The end result, Lemon Skunk, was named in High Times’ Top 10 Strains of the year in 2009. It also took 1st Indoor Hydro at Spannabis Cup 2008, 1st Outdoor at Highlife Cup in 2007 and 2nd place at IC420 Breeders Cup in 2008. 

Lemon Skunk grows short with light green leaves, thick orange hairs, and dense, compact flowers. To get the fullness of Lemon Skunk’s sweet citrus flavor and aroma, the seed bank recommends harvesting after 50-56 days of flowering. 

Currently, DNA Genetics offers only feminized Lemon Skunk seeds.

The seed bank reports the strain delivers a strong, hypnotic high, and a long- lasting piney aroma. 

T.H. Seeds founder Adam Dunn said the strain is the first European cross to use an American OG Kush. The seed bank reports MK Ultra mainly has Indica lineage and grows short, producing frosty colas with high resin yields in a 56-63 day flowering cycle.

Northern Lights,northern-lights,indica,"Northern Lights is one of the most famous and sought-after “Indica” strains of all time. Considered a descendant of Afghani and Thai landrace strains, the exact origin of Northern Lights remains a bit of a mystery. It may have originated in Washington in the 1970s, prior to reaching the Netherlands, where breeder Neville Schoenmaker pioneered several Northern Lights phenotypes in the ’80s for The Seed Bank, an early iteration of Sensi Seeds.

Since 1985, when Sensi Seeds first commercialized this strain, Northern Lights has been a landmark Indica strain in cannabis culture. Northern Lights #5 — arguably the most popular Northern Lights phenotype — won the Cannabis Cup in 1989, 1990, and 1992. Sensi Seeds currently offers feminized, non-feminized, and autoflowering Northern Lights seeds. 


","Northern Lights is relatively easy to grow both indoors and outdoors. It grows to a relatively average height with dense, resinous flowers and dark green leaves, with a flowering time of 45-50 days. When growing outdoors, a sunny, pleasantly warm climate will produce the highest yields from this strain. Northern Lights is frequently reported to exhibit effects such as full-body relaxation and sedative euphoria. Northern Lights is also known for its sweet-and-spicy scent and its skunky, earthy flavor.

OG Kush,og-kush,hybrid,"OG Kush is a world-famous strain first propagated by Matt Berger in Florida. The strain was later popularized after JoshD was able to perfect the growing conditions and introduce the variety into the Los Angeles market. JoshD Farms reports OG Kush users can expect long-lasting, heavy, yet versatile euphoria and skunky-citrus flavor and aroma. The company is now focused exclusively on developing OG Kush-derived strains and products.

JoshD Farms reports an average THC content of 20% from OG Kush, with some indoor grows testing as high as 26%. Myrcene, Limonene, and caryophyllene are the dominant terpenes of the strain. According to JoshD Farms, phenotypes and offspring that honor OG Kush’s signature effect and flavor profile include Kosher Kush, Triangle Kush, Skywalker OG, and Loompa’s Headband. 

Matt Berger said he obtained the originating strain, a ’90s favorite of Snoop Dogg and B-Real of Cypress Hill, in Florida where it was shared exclusively among local growers under the name Kryptonite, or Krippy, to designate its alleged Seattle origins. It was shipped from Seattle to Florida in dense bricks and also referred to as Supernaut and Kush. 

Del Rosso said the strain was passed between Florida breeders Alec Anderson and Matt “Bubba” Berger in 1992. Berger, who was the first to cultivate Kush seeds in Florida from a random bag of flower, later shared the strain with Del Rosso in Los Angeles. Berger was also reportedly the first to coin the name Kush after a friend called the strain’s especially frosty colas “Kushberries,” with no intentional reference to the Hindu Kush mountains where other “Kush” strains originate.

OG Kush also came in 1st place for the Weedmaps March Madness competition in 2020.","Del Rosso was the first to cultivate Kush in California, sharing cuttings with friends and fellow growers, and renaming it OG Kush (OG being short for “Original,” not “Ocean Grown” or “Original Gangster” as is often rumored) to differentiate his Florida plant from phenotypes cultivated by other breeders. When OG Kush first started to proliferate through the market, many growers reproduced the plant without the right indoor grow conditions, and the results often have varied in quality, effect, and flavor profile. OG Kush is meant to signify that the strain was grown properly by Josh and his original crew of breeders.

JoshD also reports that OG Kush is difficult to grow because it’s highly sensitive to changes in light and nutrient levels and can be susceptible to pests. Successful growers will find OG Kush has a 58-day flowering period and develops sizable yields of triangle-shaped colas covered in oily, shiny trichomes. Sugar leaves are green with streaks of lavender and pink. Testing from Phylos Bioscience reveals moderate genetic variation in the strain.

Pennywise,pennywise,hybrid,"Pennywise is a CBD-rich hybrid from California’s TGA Genetics. After years of research and development to create a strain high in CBD, TGA landed on a cross between a Harlequin female and a Jack the Ripper male. The result was Pennywise, averaging 12-15% CBD with equal ratios of THC. According to TGA co-founder Subcool, Pennywise began in 2007 when he worked with a rare Harlequin cut from breeder Chef Joel of Norstar Genetics, who holds the same Harlequin cutting today.  

According to TGA, Pennywise has four main phenotypes -- traits the earth pulls from the plant’s genetic code -- exhibiting varying amounts of coffee, lemon and bubblegum flavors. All four are reported by the breeder to produce both the relaxing, therapeutic effects of Harlequin and the invigorating effects of Jack the Ripper. Per Subcool, the goal with Pennywise is a 1:1 THC/CBD ratio -- with the most popular phenotype testing at 11% THC, 11% CBD. 


","TGA reports Pennywise has a short-to-medium growth, purple/green leaves and dense, medium-sized buds with a 56-63 day flowering period. Whether growing indoors or out, TGA recommends topping only once, as the stretch on most Pennywise phenotypes should be limited. 

Today, TGA produces Pennywise seeds using a Jack the Ripper male that tests high in THC-V.

Pink Lemonade,pink-lemonade,hybrid,"Pink Lemonade (Unknown Breeder) 
Pink Lemonade is a bit of mystery and not to be confused by Annunaki’s Pink LemonAid or Mosca Seeds Pink Lemon-Aid, there’s also a Pink Lemonade strain that has mysterious origins. This fruity strain comes from unknown parents that some sources online report as Purple Kush, Lemon Skunk, and a third strain that is not disclosed.

No seeds or clones are available for sale online and, accordingly, growing information is scarce, but several sources claim that this Pink Lemonade strain has glistening resin, bronze pistils, and a sweet, fruity, earthy flavor profile. 


Pink LemonAid by Annunaki Genetics
Breeder Annunaki Genetics originally created its first version of Pink LemonAid by crossing Huckleberry Hound with Lemon Cheesecake. Later on, it swapped out Huckleberry Hound for Huckleberry Soda, already a top strain for the company, to concoct Pink LemonAid V2, a plant with beautiful pink and purplish-green buds. The resulting strain has a sweet, lemony flavor profile and about 21% THC, according to the breeder. Pink LemonAid reportedly has  very high resin production, and that there’s little difference between the two versions despite having two fathers.

According to Annunaki, Pink LemonAid has three phenotypes, two heavy sativa and one that leans more toward indica. The sativa-leaning phenotypes grow tall and lanky, flower in about eight weeks, and have average yields. The indica-leaning phenotype is short and stocky, flowering in eight weeks with a more earthy aroma and larger yields than the other phenotypes Its version of Pink LemonAid won first place in Mixed Light (Greenhouse) at the 2018 Emerald Cup in Santa Rosa, California.


Pink Lemon-Aid by Mosca Seeds
There’s also a Pink Lemon-Aid from the breeder Mosca Seeds, which took a Lemon G female and crossed it with a Pink 2.0 male to create its own version of this strain, with pale green glistening buds and a citrus flavor profile, according to the breeder.

This strain is the winner of more than a dozen awards, (including first place Bio at Highlife Cannabis Cup in 1999, third Place at the 2005 High Times Cannabis Cup, and first Hydro at High Life Cannabis Cup in 2010. 

Sensi Star grows short and dense with thick, dark-green leaves in a flowering time of 56 to 63 days. Its stonelike buds are heavily frosted with well-pronounced trichomes, delivering a metallic, minty-sweet flavor. Though an outdoor grow with plenty of sun will generally get the highest yields from Sensi Star, the strain’s compact size makes it great for indoor growing as well. It responds particularly well to Sea of Green (SOG) and Screen of Green (SCROG) systems, as its side branches can also be high-yielding.

Stardawg,stardawg,hybrid,"StarDawg, or Star Dawg, is a cross between a female Chemdawg 4 and a male Tres Dawg. Propagated by JJ Edwards of Top Dawg Seeds in 2011, Star Dawg is said to express a couple of phenotypes, one of which is considered Indica-dominant and the other considered to be Sativa-dominant. 

While the most famous StarDawg pheno, the Guava cut, won first place in the Best Sativa category at the 2012 Denver High Times Medical Cannabis Cup, the strain has been updated and reissued four times since 2011. 

The newest variations from StarDawg’s gene pool are referred to as the Illuminati, Corey Haim, and Kate Upton cuts. Despite sharing the same gene pool, each cut provides a slightly different flavor profile, smell, effect, plant structure, and flowering time. Of the varied cuts, Kate Upton is the most purple, Guava is the sweetest and produces the heaviest yields, while the Corey Haim and Illuminati cuts are claimed to be the most potent.

Dependent on the cut of StarDawg cultivated, the strain will either produce a short, compact, fast-flowering, Indica-dominant plant; or a fast-stretching, rapidly blossoming, Sativa-dominant plant. Indoors, the Sativa-leaning cut of Stardawg will finish flowering in roughly 63-73 days, while outdoor cultivators will need to wait until early October in the Northern Hemisphere, or early April in the Southern Hemisphere before they can harvest. The Indica-dominant cut of StarDawg, grown either indoors or outdoors, will take roughly 65 days to fully mature after entering the flowering period.

Tahoe OG,tahoe-og,hybrid,"Tahoe OG was created in the Lake Tahoe/Mammoth region by California breeder Ganja Guru, who crossed OG Kush phenotypes to achieve one of the most potent phenos possible. 

The Tahoe strain contains all the excellence of its Kush heritage and its origin has been a source of confusion among breeders.

Several online sources report Tahoe was developed in the 1980s, but that timeframe is inconsistent with the 1992 emergence of OG Kush -- of which Tahoe OG is a phenotype. In fact, recent genetic testing confirmed certain Tahoe cuts are related to OG Kush.

OG Kush appeared when breeder Matt “Bubba” Burger brought his Florida-grown strain to new, indoor settings engineered by California’s JoshD of JoshD Farms. The OG stood for “original,” and indicated the strain was part of the ’92 cut grown by Burger and his team. 

From there, Ganja Guru moved a step further with Tahoe OG, selecting phenotypes based on THC levels and trichome density.

Tahoe OG grows short and squat, reaching heights of 4 feet in 8-9 weeks of indoor growing. Advanced growers should harvest from the top down, allowing lower buds to gain more light exposure. 

The strain reeks long before cutting, with alpha-Pinene and humulene contributing to its signature Kush aroma. 

Its desirability earned the cultivar 3rd place for Best Indica at the 2011 Cannabis Cup.

White Widow,white-widow,hybrid,"White Widow is a cross of two landrace strains, Brazilian and south Indian, from Green House Seed Company in Amsterdam. Green House breeder Arjan Roskam reports having developed White Widow in the early ’90s with fellow Netherlands breeder Ingemar. 

According to Arjan, the strain’s original name was Arnhem’s Wonder before he and Ingemar commercialized it in seed form and changed the name to White Widow. The winner of first place Bio at High Times Cannabis Cup in 1995, White Widow delivers a strong peppery cedar flavor and a complex, long-lasting high that starts with a relaxing haze and gives way to an explosive buzz, as reported by Green House. 


Green House has tested White Widow at 18.76% THC, 0.10% CBD, and 0.28% CBN. The seed bank has also developed autoflowering and high-CBD autoflowering versions of the strain by hybridizing White Widow with Ruderalis and high-CBD strains, respectively. Green House Seed Co. carries all three versions of White Widow in feminized seed form.
","According to Green House, White Widow grows short with light green leaves and white, crystal resin-covered buds in a 56-63 day flowering period. The seed bank also recommends letting the plant flower for the full 63 days to get its full spectrum of cannabinoids and terpenes. Green House also reports that White Widow grows well indoors — especially under the Screen of Green (SCROG) method — and outdoors in mild, temperate climates.
